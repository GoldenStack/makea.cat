# makea.cat

Make a cat at 2:22 !!! :3

---

makea.cat is a parody of [makea.fish](http://makea.fish/), but for cats instead of fish, and at 2:22 instead of 11:11.

makea.cat is a rust application written with axum with 'very strong cheat prevention measures' [[1]](https://mas.to/@honbra/113582500248516791). per a few friends, the anticheat is rather frustrating. :)

makea.cat uses [raqote](https://github.com/jrmuizel/raqote), the canvas library used by [servo](https://github.com/servo/servo). this is primarily to ensure that spam reloading won't kill my $3.5/mo VPS.

many text fields on makea.cat include a translation into [catalan](https://govern.cat/gov/). this is because .cat is short for catalunya/catalonia, and .cat domains are required promote the catalan language and culture! i have learned that this is never checked, but i translated it anyway.

don't make fun of my code ok it's great

NOTE: now that i have somewhat of a platform, please listen to the (unofficial) makea.fish album!!! i'm not involved with them at all i just really like the album
